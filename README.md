# slices-of-code

A collection of my code from over the years:

Python:

The python folder includes a couple programs from when I first started coding (python being my first language!). After seeing youtubers online create simple games using python, I ended up watching a 5 hour-long crash course video on Python and tried applying what I learned to various ideas I had. Looking back at the code now, there are numerous bugs in the programs, but it wouldn't be a a first attempt at coding if that wasn't the case.

C:

The C folder contains several C programs I have created last year while learning the language. Instructions on how to run the code is in the folder.

Java:

Java is the language I know best. Within the folder are some of my favorite programs I have written in Java to date.
